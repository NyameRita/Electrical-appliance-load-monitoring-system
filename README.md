Title: Electrical Appliance Load Monitoring System (Week 1)

Overview
This week focused on setting up the project structure and building the core appliance data model. The aim is to track appliances (name, wattage, usage hours/day) and prepare for later energy and billing calculations.

What I implemented

Defined an Appliance structure to store:

appliance name

power rating (W)

usage hours per day

Created a simple menu skeleton for navigation.

Set up basic program flow (main() loop).

Why it matters

The Appliance model is the foundation for all later features (energy calculation, billing, saving/loading).

A menu-driven structure makes the program easy to extend
